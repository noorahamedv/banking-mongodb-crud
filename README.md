# üè¶ Banking System Analytics using MongoDB Atlas

This project implemented a realistic banking scenario using **MongoDB Atlas** to manage small scale financial transactions, customer profiles, and account activity. Stimulated real-world business transactions with a NoSQL schema and includes CRUD operations and aggregations.

## üöÄ Project Features

- Built a MongoDB database for a banking business case
- Defined **4 core collections**:
  - `BS.Customers`
  - `BS.Accounts`
  - `BS.Loans`
  - `BS.Transactions`
- Populated each collection with 10+ documents
- Exported data as **CSV files** from MongoDB Compass
- Exported **collection schemas** as JSON and described each in Word
- Used **MongoDB Playgrounds** in VS Code for CRUD & Aggregation

## üî® CRUD Operations (in MongoDB Playground)

Each collection has full support for:

- `insertOne()`, `insertMany()`
- `findOne()`, `find()`
- `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`
- `deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()`

### ‚úÖ Example:
```js
// Read all customers
db.getCollection('BS.Customers').find();

// Update customer phone number
db.getCollection('BS.Customers').updateOne(
  { customer_id: "C1001" },
  { $set: { phone: "+1-999-888-7777" } }
);
