# üè¶ Banking System Analytics using MongoDB Atlas

This project implemented a realistic banking scenario using **MongoDB Atlas** to manage small scale financial transactions, customer profiles, and account activity. Stimulated real-world business transactions with a NoSQL schema and includes CRUD operations and aggregations.

## üöÄ Project Features

- Built a MongoDB database for a banking business case
- Defined **4 core collections**:
  - `BS.Customers`
  - `BS.Accounts`
  - `BS.Loans`
  - `BS.Transactions`
- Populated each collection with 10+ documents
- Exported data as **CSV files** from MongoDB Compass
- Exported **collection schemas** as JSON and described each in Word
- Used **MongoDB Playgrounds** in VS Code for CRUD & Aggregation

## üß± Collections & Purpose

1. **Customers**  
   - Stores customer identity, contact info, and KYC details.
   - Keys: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `dob`, `address`

2. **Accounts**  
   - Contains account numbers, balance info, type (e.g., savings/current), and links to customers.
   - Keys: `account_id`, `customer_id`, `account_type`, `balance`

3. **Loans**  
   - Captures loan type, amount, repayment status and links to customers.
   - Keys: `loan_id`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `interest_rate`, `status`

4. **Transactions**  
   - Tracks deposit/withdrawal operations with timestamps and descriptions.
   - Keys: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `amount`, `type`, `timestamp`, `description`

Aggregation Pipelines:
- Total loan amount by status
- Transaction volume by account type
- Customer distribution by city
- Average account balance by type

Business Scenario:

This project simulates a digital banking environment where customers hold multiple accounts, perform transactions, apply for loans, and update personal data. Using MongoDB's flexible document model, the database is optimized for fast query and high scalability.

## üî® CRUD Operations (in MongoDB Playground)

Each collection has full support for:

- `insertOne()`, `insertMany()`
- `findOne()`, `find()`
- `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`
- `deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()`

### ‚úÖ Example:
```js
// Read all customers
db.getCollection('BS.Customers').find();

// Update customer phone number
db.getCollection('BS.Customers').updateOne(
  { customer_id: "C1001" },
  { $set: { phone: "+1-999-888-7777" } }
);
