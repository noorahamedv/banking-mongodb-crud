## ‚úÖ Conclusion: MongoDB Banking Data Analysis

Successfully modeled and analyzed a simplified banking system using **MongoDB**. Each collection represented a core component of banking operations and the aggregation pipelines provided meaningful business insights.

### üîç Key Findings:

- **Account Balances**:  
  Two customers hold active accounts with balances of **$5,000** and **$3,500**, respectively. This allows tracking and summarizing customer-level financial holdings using `$group`.

- **Customer Demographics**:  
  Customers are evenly distributed by name initials ‚Äî **2 with names starting with "A"** and **2 with "B"**, demonstrating how MongoDB can support segmentation analysis via `$substr`.

- **Loan Distribution**:  
  One customer (ID `"1"`) has borrowed **$15,000** with an **average interest rate of 5.75%**, while another borrowed **$7,000** at **4.5%**, showing MongoDB's ability to analyze risk profiles and lending portfolios.

- **Transaction Behavior**:  
  Deposits and withdrawals were tracked per account. For example:
  - Account `1234567890`: **$2,000** deposited, **$500** withdrawn  
  - Account `2345678901`: **$1,500** deposited, **$300** withdrawn  
  This enables a clear view of account activity, essential for detecting trends, managing liquidity, or spotting anomalies.

### üí° Business Takeaway:
MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable foundation for modeling real-world banking scenarios. With document-based storage, it supports both **transactional workloads** and **analytical queries** using rich CRUD and aggregation operations ‚Äî all within a single NoSQL ecosystem.
